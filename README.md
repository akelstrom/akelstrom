# Description
This is my first version of my porfolio site made during my first two weeks of my coding journey. It features 5 projects, along with an "About Me" section and a "Contact Me" section. I used HTML and CSS to create this website, with special attention to utilizing CSS Flexbox and CSS grid. My new portfolio, made more recently can be viewed here: https://akelstrom.github.io/portfolio-ak/.
